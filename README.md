# ArgDb

This is an Honours Project for Edinburgh Napier University for the degree of Computing 2017

Argumentation theory and its research have been around for thousands of years, but there is yet to be invented a high quality technological tool to aid contemporary researchers in creating, storing, and retrieving analysed arguments. This project adopts Dr Simon Wells' Simple Argument Description Format (SADFace) - a new argument description format developed to simplify representing arguments for reuse by software tools on the web. Aims of this project are to support the ongoing research into the field of argumentation at Edinburgh Napier University and all around the world, and to provide argument data for a number of applications that are currently under construction. In this paper are described the design and implementation of a JSON-based document-oriented database, accompanied by a RESTful API and a web interface.
